Even though the world has seen the imersive capabilities of large vision language models, particularly in zero-shot inference, such models struggle with hallucinations, which can be referred to as the generation of text with information that is not present in the visual input. Lots of research work is going on to tackle this problem, such as hallucinated objects, inaccurate attributes and relationships, unfaithful descriptions, and so on. Possible reasons behind this could be language prior, insufficient visual context, biases and misinformation in the training dataset, and so on.

This repository will provide an organized list of state-of-the-art research papers, relevant code, and a brief description related to hallucinations of the Large-Vision-Language Model (LVLM), also known as the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM).

The main intention of this project is to provide a platform where all the research work in the field of hallucination in LVLMs is accessed in a constructive way. If you have any suggestions for intersecting work within this field, kindly contribute them by raising an open issue. I am looking forward to fruitful discussion and learning!Â
